# Overview 
Climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time. Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions, or in the time variation of weather within the context of longer-term average conditions. 
Powerful analytics tool is beneficial for the public to have visibility towards climate changes in order to understand the long term effect. Also this creates awareness among public to make necessary measures to minimize the impact due to human activities.   
Objective Climate data is being collected from varies sensors installed across the world and they are publicly available from different organizations including government and non-governmental institutions. By applying proper analytics on this data, it can be derived meaningful insights and predictions for the wellbeing of general public. 

# Data Sources 

The World Bank Group is one of the worldâ€™s largest sources of funding and knowledge for developing countries. Its five institutions share a commitment to reducing poverty, increasing shared prosperity, and promoting sustainable development. The data for this project is taken from open source world bank data repository.

## Response Variables: World bank (climateportal)
http://sdwebx.worldbank.org/climateportal/index.cfm?page=downscaled_data_download&menu=historical.

### Temperature and precipitation are the response or dependent variables we have used for this analysis.  


# Shiny Visualization Tabs

## TAB 1: Relationship and Trend Analysis 

This provides a descriptive analysis of response variables i.e. Temperature and Precipitation as a function of explanatory variables sub setting into regions, countries. Here a user can have a data sensing of the relationship between these variables and how they are changing over period of time annually. 
A regression analysis is provided for further understanding or data taking feature matrix as explanatory variables and target variables as response variables. 

## TAB 2: Response Variable Analysis  
This provides an animation timely changing relationship between the response variables. How the maximum precipitation is changing as a function of maximum temperature in different regions globally. 

## TAB 3: Explanatory Variable Analysis 
MAP visualization to observe how the explanatory variables are distributed globally. This is provided to for the user to further have a sense of the data we use. For example, which data is not is not available, the variable distribution etc. 

## TAB 4: Reference Data 
This tab include explanation of variables.
